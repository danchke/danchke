### Hello, I'm Dani ðŸ‘‹

##### I've spent the last six years as a structural engineer but I've always had a facination with coding. My first taste of coding was with MATLAB while I was at university and was immediately hooked when fifth order differential equations were solved in a matter of seconds! 

##### As a structural engineer, was introduced to parametric modelling to create tools that would improve efficiency and optimise processes and was taken back to fun of coding when I had to create snippets of Python or C# code to perform functions that were not available within a standard software package. The little snippets of code now no longer satisfy me and I am looking for bigger challenges!

##### I've spent this year upskilling my coding knowledge, mostly in Python but I am always hungry and willing to learn more. I have an MEng in Civil Engineering from Imperial College London where I did a lot of heavy Mathematical coding in MATLAB to solve problems in Fluid Mecahnics.
